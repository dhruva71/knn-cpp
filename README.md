# KNN CPP

This is a simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in C++. The code is designed to classify data points based on their nearest neighbors in a given dataset.

# Usage
* Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
* Generate a dataset using the `generate_datapoints_csv.py` script. This writes to a `build` directory.
* Run the compiled program to classify the data point. Currently the input data point is hardcoded in the `main` function.
